# Spring Boot Security Project
## This repository contains a Spring Boot Security project focused on implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms using Spring Security. 
The project demonstrates how to secure RESTful APIs, manage user roles, and protect sensitive endpoints.

## Features
```
User Authentication: Implements user login functionality with Spring Security.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Defines user roles and restricts access to specific endpoints based on roles.
JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication: Secures endpoints with JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
Secure REST API: Protects REST API endpoints from unauthorized access.
Password Hashing: Utilizes BCrypt for secure password storage.
Spring Security Configuration: Customizes Spring Security configuration to manage security rules and filter chains.
```
## Technologies Used
```
Java: Core language for the project
Spring Boot: Framework for rapid application development
Spring Security: For authentication and authorization
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure token-based authentication
Spring Data JPA: For database interactions
BCrypt: For secure password hashing
```
